              <h2>So how do you play Pig?</h2>
                <br>
                  <li> Click on the play button to start the game</li>
                    <li>Input the names of  player one and two. Player one rolls the dice first!</li>
                      <li> A player gains as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1</li>
                        <li> The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn by clicking on hold.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.</li>
            <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
              <h3>How do you win?</h3>
              <p>The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.</p>
